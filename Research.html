    <h2 class="myH2">Opportunities</h2>
    <p class="myP">
        In an ever-changing world, almost anything is possible to produce with
        the help of technology which goes the same for Artificial Intelligence
        (AI) Robots in surgical health care. As of now the role of robotic
        surgery in the operation room is a computer-controlled device designed
        to assist with the manipulation and positioning of surgical instruments,
        enabling the surgeon to dedicate all his/her attention to then intricate
        parts of the surgery. Offering unparalleled control in terms of speed
        and movement, minimizing hand tremors, and avoiding accidental hand
        movements. This gives surgeons to operate with increased flexibility,
        precision, agility, and greater control, especially during surgeries
        that are physically. Today’s surgical robot AI is restricted to image
        recognition algorithm for pre-operative planning, however the
        opportunity for AI to be integrated with Surgical Robots is limitless.

    <p class="myP">
        At this point, we ponder the question “Sure, that sounds cool, but will
        it be practical, and will it work in real organizations?”. Artificial
        Intelligence into surgery was introduced more recently, however with a
        strong root in imaging, navigation, and early techniques focus on
        feature detection and computer-assisted intervention for both
        preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. Previously, the first
        surgical robots were the Arthrobot, which had built in voice commands to
        assist in patient positioning during an orthopedic case. In 1996, the
        Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning (AESOP), was able to
        obtain the first FDA-approved robotic surgical system (Zemmar et al,
        2020), called ZEUS. Which led to the first long-distance tele-surgical
        procedure on a patient in Strasbourg, while the surgeon was in New York.
        Impressive for the technology they were presented during their time. In
        New Zealand, the Ministry of Health, provided a list of robots that can
        be used within the Health System, wherein Surgical Robots are included.
        In fact, in 2007, the first robotic surgery was first performed at Grace
        Hospital, Tauranga, where surgeon Peter Giling performed a robotic
        assisted prostatectomy for a patient with prostate cancer (Ministry of
        Health, 2019). Additionally, according to New Zealand’s Ministry of
        Health, there are currently three Da Vinci Robots, which specialises in
        translating the surgeon’s hand movements into smaller and precise
        movements.

        AI surgical will come to play, especially in the age of COVID-19 where
        it has caused us to distant from each other, which brings a potential
        threat to surgeons and nurses working in clinical and hospitals. To
        effectively reduce, the spread, AI robotic surgery can be integrated at
        several sections of the sequence, which each surgical patient traverses
        during a hospital stay. Allowing for the workflow to be divided into
        pre-operative care, anesthesia, the surgical procedure and postoperative
        care, the overall goal of this is to minimize contact between patient
        and healthcare provider at each step. AI can be the next frontier for
        surgical robots, the Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) a powered by
        AI, used to detect tissue motion (Leonard et al, 2014), in one trial it
        was able to successfully sew pig intestine for diagnostic purposes gave
        an insight into the use of AI in surgical robotics. Giving us an
        insight, the benefit of completely automated robots is well worth the
        investment. Interest in AI robotic surgery is rising due to the fact
        they bring in multiple benefits. One of which is the manpower planning,
        as doctor-patient ratio is steadily declining, and robots are a great
        way to tackle that. Another is they will be a great help in assisting
        surgeons in micro-surgical procedures, even though it is still a
        far-fetched concept, AI surgical robot can provide valuable, real-time
        inputs to enable surgeons to perform better. However, the design of an
        AI is just as important as the design of the surgical robot itself as AI
        allows the robot to work unsupervised which needs to be very well
        designed due to the stakes at hand.

        In an ever-changing world, almost anything is possible to produce with the help of technology which goes the
        same for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Robots in surgical health care. As of now the role of robotic surgery in
        the operation room is a computer-controlled device designed to assist with the manipulation and positioning of
        surgical instruments, enabling the surgeon to dedicate all his/her attention to then intricate parts of the
        surgery. Offering unparalleled control in terms of speed and movement, minimizing hand tremors, and avoiding
        accidental hand movements. This gives surgeons to operate with increased flexibility, precision, agility, and
        greater control, especially during surgeries that are physically. Today’s surgical robot AI is restricted to
        image recognition algorithm for pre-operative planning, however the opportunity for AI to be integrated with
        Surgical Robots is limitless.
    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        At this point, we ponder the question “Sure, that sounds cool, but will it be practical, and will it work in
        real organizations?”. Artificial Intelligence into surgery was introduced more recently, however with a strong
        root in imaging, navigation, and early techniques focus on feature detection and computer-assisted intervention
        for both preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. Previously, the first surgical robots were the
        Arthrobot, which had built in voice commands to assist in patient positioning during an orthopedic case. In
        1996, the Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning (AESOP), was able to obtain the first FDA-approved
        robotic surgical system (Zemmar et al, 2020), called ZEUS. Which led to the first long-distance tele-surgical
        procedure on a patient in Strasbourg, while the surgeon was in New York. Impressive for the technology they were
        presented during their time. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Health, provided a list of robots that can be used
        within the Health System, wherein Surgical Robots are included. In fact, in 2007, the first robotic surgery was
        first performed at Grace Hospital, Tauranga, where surgeon Peter Giling performed a robotic assisted
        prostatectomy for a patient with prostate cancer (Ministry of Health, 2019). Additionally, according to New
        Zealand’s Ministry of Health, there are currently three Da Vinci Robots, which specialises in translating the
        surgeon’s hand movements into smaller and precise movements.

        AI surgical will come to play, especially in the age of COVID-19 where it has caused us to distant from each
        other, which brings a potential threat to surgeons and nurses working in clinical and hospitals. To effectively
        reduce, the spread, AI robotic surgery can be integrated at several sections of the sequence, which each
        surgical patient traverses during a hospital stay. Allowing for the workflow to be divided into pre-operative
        care, anesthesia, the surgical procedure and postoperative care, the overall goal of this is to minimize contact
        between patient and healthcare provider at each step. AI can be the next frontier for surgical robots, the Smart
        Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) a powered by AI, used to detect tissue motion (Leonard et al, 2014), in one trial
        it was able to successfully sew pig intestine for diagnostic purposes gave an insight into the use of AI in
        surgical robotics. Giving us an insight, the benefit of completely automated robots is well worth the
        investment. Interest in AI robotic surgery is rising due to the fact they bring in multiple benefits. One of
        which is the manpower planning, as doctor-patient ratio is steadily declining, and robots are a great way to
        tackle that. Another is they will be a great help in assisting surgeons in micro-surgical procedures, even
        though it is still a far-fetched concept, AI surgical robot can provide valuable, real-time inputs to enable
        surgeons to perform better. However, the design of an AI is just as important as the design of the surgical
        robot itself as AI allows the robot to work unsupervised which needs to be very well designed due to the stakes
        at hand.

    <p class="myP">
        With an AI-based algorithm and the combination with the precision and control of surgical robots will
        revolutionize the way humans look at surgeries in this age. The combination of this will provide the ability to
        simplify the medium of interaction between surgical robots and surgeons with the help of AI. It allows itself to
        recognize and determine the movements and patterns of a surgeon during surgery and possibly convert them into
        actionable commands for the robot, in other words the AI will collect data over time by watching surgeons
        perform. With the assistance of collection data and algorithms, AI will have a huge contribution in assisting
        surgical robots with reasoning and performing of cognitive functions like decision-making, problem-solving,
        speech-recognition.

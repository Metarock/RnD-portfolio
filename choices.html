    <h2 class="myH2">Choices</h2>
    <p class="myP">
        When adopting RAS through the DaVinci system many choices must be made throughout the implementation process of
        the technology, consideration must be placed towards the autonomy, control and the accountability (Simpson,
        2016) of the choices and actions which these robotics may be making in the future. This may involve new
        legislations having to be produced for certain robotics. As stated by (Puaschunder, 2019, 1), many countries
        such as the European Union may need to consider certain laws permitting the freedoms within which these AI
        systems will be processing patients data and how they respond to this to avoid factors such as discrimination,
        and gentrification. Because AI systems and robotics will be storing information about patients for future
        medical records, and AI is becoming part of the digital infrastructure (Regan-Ingram, 2020, 3), these laws may
        become more and more important to prevent the sharing of sensory information of patients to third parties for
        additional monetary benefit.
    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        RAS improvements may lead to ethical concerns regarding the ever increasing level of autonomy within these
        procedures, and thus patients may experience a lack of human interaction and a lack of comfort when receiving
        procedures. Thus future choices may be presented as the surgical healthcare progresses there may be a resistance
        or unwillingness from members of society to receive surgical healthcare from robotics as they feel it lacks
        personalisation and don’t trust that the robotics can provide them with the adequate assistance which they
        require (Longoni et al., 2019). Longoni has also identified that in many places where medical care is not
        subsidised, many people are willing to pay less money for surgical health care which is supplied by an AI robot
        as opposed to directly by a human. Which may mean that it makes the implementation of such robotics much harder
        as health care practices may receive less patients or have to lower prices, while still paying for expensive
        robotics to be installed and the ongoing maintenance costs of these robotics. Thus many health care practices
        may also need to choose whether it will be financially beneficial to implement these robotics, at least while
        they are still expensive to implement.
    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        As more surgical systems are produced and have more technological advancements a choice must be made where the
        line is drawn on the amount of control the AI surgical robots may have over decisions in the future as well as
        how much of the surgical process the robot controls. As the automation of surgery progresses further and further
        we may experience more job loss for humans who now find there many years studying surgery making them redundant.
        (Kasperbauer, 2020, 4) highlights the choice where AI and humanised healthcare converge and there must be a
        reconsideration of the roles of humans in the future of robotic surgery. This choice may be either positive or
        negative as it will only be able to be assessed years into the future to determine whether the intertwining of
        development of AI and development of human surgical learning can find a positive middlegrounds where both are
        being used most efficiently.
    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        Another choice may be the forms of surgery which allow for RAS, as the severity of the surgery may require
        different forms of attention. Many patients may be willing for certain robotics to conduct the operation if it
        is a smaller scale operation while if there is more severity in the operation, many patients may not trust
        robotics to conduct the operation because of a lack of understanding the robotics (Longoni et al., 2019). A
        positive choice through this may be that a select number of patients who may be receiving longer surgeries may
        possibly find themselves more inclined to allow robotics to conduct the surgery because unlike humans, robotics
        won’t change how it operates the longer the surgery progresses.
    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        Healthcare practices may need to decide between which RAS system to use, as there are different systems such as
        Verb, Zeus, and DaVinci which all cover RAS, however they may operate in different ways. This is a positive
        choice for the healthcare industry, as it provides more choice between which system to use, meaning with more
        competition the AI systems must not only be the most practical, but also the most ethically poised to meet
        certain regulations and be the most beneficial for society with the least drawbacks. Because there are many AI
        robotics systems which are operating in harmful manners and may be unethical (Regan-Ingram, 2020, 1), this
        greater choice over which robotic assisted surgery system to use may improve the future for the intertwining of
        robotics within surgical health care.

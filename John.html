    <h2 class="myH2">John's Ethical Reflection</h2>
    <p class="myR">
        The world is rapidly developing especially for robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, heavily
        invested in the 20th century on the use of robots on various fields in the healthcare industry. This exciting
        technology brings potential and may change the way we work in the healthcare. One of the advantages is that it
        gives healthcare easier and faster for people to access (Ministry of Health, 2019), the ability to offer new
        technology and services to
        patients allowing automation of physical tasks, in this case AI surgical robots, so that workforce can focus
        more on a patient’s wellbeing. Thus, increasing the accuracy of service delivery and remove a subsequential
        amount of human error, improving the overall productivity of the healthcare workflow.
    </p>
    <p class="myR">
        However, implementation of AI to surgical robots also comes with ethical challenges as the healthcare industry
        would need to consider their stakeholders. Yes, AI integrated with surgical robot may improve the overall
        productivity of the health system, increase value in service delivery. However, one of the questions I ponder as
        I was doing this project is safety along with privacy, and I believe it is one of the biggest challenges that
        the AI faces in the workforce. An example of this is IBM Watson for Oncology which basically uses an AI to train
        and assess patient’s information medical records and assist physicians to explore cancer treatment options
        (Gerke et al, 2020). But this backed fired, as the AI’s recommendation were deemed to be unsafe and incorrect
        for cancer treatments, due to the AI being trained to a few “case studies” rather than real patient’s data. This
        potentially brings inconsistency and may need a revision of regulation and procurement of devices & services.
        Endangering any patient’s sensitive data as a learning mechanism for AI system, another issue is the fairness
        and algorithmic bias in AI. In fact, Amazon has tried this approach, developing an AI recruiting tool to assist
        the human resource (HR) department in recruiting employees. However, the AI showed bias against women and other
        race color, teaching itself that male candidates were preferable and more dominate. We can only imagine the
        effects it may bring to the healthcare industry, if it were to be implemented, unintended statistical biases
        caused by difference in sampling may reflect and amplify existing cultural prejudices and inequalities
    </p>
    <p class="myR">
        So here is my recommendation with AI integrated to surgical robots. We need to consider the ethical challenges
        of applying AI in healthcare as it involves data protection, privacy requirements, and fairness in judgement.
        Decision making should always leave to us, humans, not to artificial intelligence as it may not be effective as
        it intended to be. For an AI to be effective, it needs exposure to the real-world data and that is not what, I
        believe, the healthcare industry should risk for.

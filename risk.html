    <p class="myP">
        Although AI in surgical health can be beneficial there are also many risk factors that can be involved first and
        foremost is the ai as it is a piece of software and can never be completely full proof as there are many factors
        that can cause problems to arise as stated by Puaschunder (2019, p. 77) who explains Data corruption can occur
        during robotic surgical procedures causing the robot to either cease functioning mid operation causing either
        medical complication such as affecting the patients’ health or even causing permanent damage this can lead to
        repercussion felt by the hospital, which can then risk some form of lawsuit. Errors can also occur in the
        initial programming of the machine as this will not be found by the doctor who lacks knowledge in the specific
        field, which can in turn lead to an inevitable issue during surgery which can yet again prove dangerous to the
        many patients who are being operated on.

    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        There are data breaches and external intrusions that can occur as not software systems are full proof therefore
        it can allow hackers to control the medical robot during pre or post-surgery, as ai systems cannot operate
        independently from the network an example of this is the cyber-attack that occurred in New Zealand’s, Waikato
        Hospital as the attackers breached the hospital computers causing them to be shut down and surgeries being
        postponed with medical staff unable to access patient notes and information (Leahy, 2021), If an ai robotic
        system were
        present at this time would only create another avenue for hackers to get a hold of you medical records and files
        through the ai in the robotic system.

    <p class="myP">
        The gradual decrease and reliance that we begin to have on robotic surgery may cause surgeons to be completely
        replaced in the future by robotic procedures, leading to a decline of surgeons in specific surgical fields. This
        can affect the choices the patients may have, because if hospitals were to become completely reliant on robotic
        surgery, patients will no longer be able to choose whether they want to be operated on by the machines or by a
        human. Robotic surgery may cause doctor to lose the learning curve and experienced that can be gained through
        each operation, with the ai system merely following procedure that were coded into it, can also cause
        implications for the patient if a variable were to occur during the procedure, with the machine lacking the
        program and procedure required to overcome the unforeseen variable therefore placing the patient at risk of
        harm, such as issues that may affect them in the long term

        There are also many Ethical risks as described by Spillman and Sade (2014, p. 813) who explain this by breaking
        it down, as argument can be made that that robotic surgery can hurt patients, as manufacturer will need their
        robot to adhere to the same ethical principle as the surgeon, as a lack of said principals could put the patient
        at risk of harm. Another point highlighted is how malfunctions regarding the robotic machinery will cause the
        patient to suffer in the end, as they cannot see if there are any problems with the ai system, meaning they put
        their full trust in the robot operating on them. Lasty, they discuss how more potential harm can occur if both
        manufacturer and hospital are aiming to promote robotic machinery without regarding potential harm the robotic
        system may cause, because just as a surgeon has a duty to their patient, so does a manufacturer to their
        stakeholders. This can then risk in surgeons or hospital staff having their opinions ignored or overalled by
        those holding a higher position, this can in turn place the patient at risk for monetary gain. Another example
        this can also be seen in, is if a surgical centre or surgeon were try and endorse the robotic procedure without
        any sort of objective data, can be considered misleading, deceptive and unethical, as this endorsement can
        affect patient safety and wellbeing if it procedure was to be adopted by other medical centres.

            Ensured that we implement code comments when necessary. Most of the

        <p>
            Development team work on features in separate Github branches.
            Whenever a feature was complete, a Pull Request (PR) would be opened
            by one of the developers to request a merge to the main branch. The
            developer would need to answer the PR tempalte provided, and the
            merge would only be accepted by other developers after reviewing &
            testing the code changes.

            Team ensured that files and components are placed in clear
            subfolders and ensure the name of the file is simple and reflects
            its purpose. We ensured that we reffered to the standards by
            previous iterations as well to keep code consistency across the
            coding base. This include, but not limited to, camalCasing for
            objects, functions & exports, correctly indented code blocks, and
            PascalCase for folders and Components.

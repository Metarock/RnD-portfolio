    <h2 class="myH2">Choices</h2>
    <p class="myP">
        When adopting RAS through the DaVinci system many choices must be made
        throughout the implementation process of the technology, consideration
        must be placed towards the autonomy, control and the accountability
        (Simpson, 2016) of the choices and actions which these robotics may be
        making in the future. This may involve new legislations having to be
        produced for certain robotics. As stated by (Puaschunder, 2019, 1), many
        countries such as the European Union may need to consider certain laws
        permitting the freedoms within which these AI systems will be processing
        patients data and how they respond to this to avoid factors such as
        discrimination, and gentrification. Because AI systems and robotics will
        be storing information about patients for future medical records, and AI
        is becoming part of the digital infrastructure (Regan-Ingram, 2020, 3),
        these laws may become more and more important to prevent the sharing of
        sensory information of patients to third parties for additional monetary
        benefit.
    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        RAS improvements may lead to ethical concerns regarding the ever
        increasing level of autonomy within these procedures, and thus patients
        may experience a lack of human interaction and a lack of comfort when
        receiving procedures. Thus future choices may be presented as the
        surgical healthcare progresses there may be a resistance or
        unwillingness from members of society to receive surgical healthcare
        from robotics as they feel it lacks personalisation and don’t trust that
        the robotics can provide them with the adequate assistance which they
        require (Longoni et al., 2019). Longoni has also identified that in many
        places where medical care is not subsidised, many people are willing to
        pay less money for surgical health care which is supplied by an AI robot
        as opposed to directly by a human. Which may mean that it makes the
        implementation of such robotics much harder as health care practices may
        receive less patients or have to lower prices, while still paying for
        expensive robotics to be installed and the ongoing maintenance costs of
        these robotics. Thus many health care practices may also need to choose
        whether it will be financially beneficial to implement these robotics,
        at least while they are still expensive to implement.
    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        As more surgical systems are produced and have more technological
        advancements a choice must be made where the line is drawn on the amount
        of control the AI surgical robots may have over decisions in the future
        as well as how much of the surgical process the robot controls. As the
        automation of surgery progresses further and further we may experience
        more job loss for humans who now find there many years studying surgery
        making them redundant. (Kasperbauer, 2020, 4) highlights the choice
        where AI and humanised healthcare converge and there must be a
        reconsideration of the roles of humans in the future of robotic surgery.
        This choice may be either positive or negative as it will only be able
        to be assessed years into the future to determine whether the
        intertwining of development of AI and development of human surgical
        learning can find a positive middlegrounds where both are being used
        most efficiently.
    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        Another choice may be the forms of surgery which allow for RAS, as the
        severity of the surgery may require different forms of attention. Many
        patients may be willing for certain robotics to conduct the operation if
        it is a smaller scale operation while if there is more severity in the
        operation, many patients may not trust robotics to conduct the operation
        because of a lack of understanding the robotics (Longoni et al., 2019).
        A positive choice through this may be that a select number of patients
        who may be receiving longer surgeries may possibly find themselves more
        inclined to allow robotics to conduct the surgery because unlike humans,
        robotics won’t change how it operates the longer the surgery progresses.
    </p>
    <p class="myP">
        Healthcare practices may need to decide between which RAS system to use,
        as there are different systems such as Verb, Zeus, and DaVinci which all
        cover RAS, however they may operate in different ways. This is a
        positive choice for the healthcare industry, as it provides more choice
        between which system to use, meaning with more competition the AI
        systems must not only be the most practical, but also the most ethically
        poised to meet certain regulations and be the most beneficial for
        society with the least drawbacks. Because there are many AI robotics
        systems which are operating in harmful manners and may be unethical
        (Regan-Ingram, 2020, 1), this greater choice over which robotic assisted
        surgery system to use may improve the future for the intertwining of
        robotics within surgical health care.

    <h3 class="myH3">
        finappster provides a platform designed to allow users to align
        financial investments with their ethical values. To do this, it presents
        users with information about potential future investments as well as
        information around their current investments. finappster also enables
        users to track the performance of their investments while providing
        insight into the ethical impact of each investment using social,
        environmental and governance factors. The founder of finappster, Leeanna
        Kohn-Hardy has been collaborating with the Research and Development
        program since 2019 and has fostered one team each semester, each working
        on various aspects of the application.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="myH3">
        Leeanna’s first team, (finappster Alpha-Omega), took the existing
        finappster application (Version Zero) that was present before AUT’s
        involvement and redeveloped it into Version One. Version One addressed
        issues present with Version Zero, bringing the codebase up to a modern
        standard. Following this, finappster Delta created a production and
        testing pipeline to facilitate future development and brought the
        application online, specifically focusing on creating a fluid, usable
        frontend. Because of this, no further architectural work has been done
        on the backend, and as such at this point it is antiquated.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="myH3">
        As of the start of this project, there is a barebones application
        online, facilitating tracking of investment performance but nothing
        more. As such there is a feature gap where the finappster product is yet
        to distinguish itself within the market.
